# Agora

This project introduces the **Agora framework**, a novel approach to model human behavior in crowd simulations. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the complexities of merging various behavior models.

**Key Features:**  

1. **Behavioral Decomposition:** Human behavior is broken down into basic driving stimuli.
2. **Heatmap Paradigm:** These stimuli are represented visually through heatmaps, guiding virtual agents toward attractive zones and away from unattractive ones.
3. **Heatmap Operations:** Different aspects of human behavior are integrated using distinct color operations on heatmaps.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The framework allows for objective comparison of simulation results with real-world data using image similarity metrics.
